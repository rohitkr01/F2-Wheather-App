## Task Description
You are tasked with creating an interactive weather dashboard that allows users to add cities and view real-time weather information. The dashboard will have an input field and an "Add" button, and users will be able to add cities to a dynamically generated list of weather cards. Each card will display specific weather information, including an image corresponding to the weather condition (rainy, sunny, cloudy, windy). The application should provide a responsive and interactive user experience.

You will use the following OpenWeatherMap API endpoint: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={CITY_NAME}&appid={API_KEY}&units=metric. You can generate your own API key by signing up at OpenWeatherMap.

This endpoint will return an object containing various weather-related properties, but you will focus on the following:

name: City Name
weather: Array containing weather conditions (e.g., "Rain", "Clear")
main: Object containing temperature, humidity, pressure
wind: Object containing wind speed and direction
clouds: Object containing cloudiness percentage
sys: Object containing country code, sunrise, and sunset times
Features
Add City: Implement an input field and an "Add" button to allow users to add cities. Validate the input to ensure that it's not empty and that the city hasn't been added before.

Weather Cards: Dynamically generate weather cards for each added city, displaying:
Weather icon corresponding to the condition (rainy, sunny, cloudy, windy)
City name, temperature (high, low, current), and weather condition
All other data received from the API (e.g., humidity, pressure, wind speed)

Sorting: Maintain the cities in an array and sort them by temperature from lowest to highest every time a city is added.

Responsive Design: Ensure that the dashboard is fully responsive and displays properly on both desktop and mobile devices.
Hints
To generate your own API key, sign up at https://openweathermap.org/appid and follow their instructions
You may use the `sort()` method to sort the array of cities by temperature.
Consider using a Set or an object to efficiently check for duplicate cities.
